This [datacube-stats](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/datacube-stats) plug-in generates outputs to robustly understand variation in the landscape. These results have been preliminarily published/presented at IGARS 2018 in [this paper](https://github.com/daleroberts/datacube-2nd-order-stats/raw/master/docs/IGARS2018-2ndOrderStats.pdf).
